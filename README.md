# HelloWorld

This is the first git file I am creating, I will try to put all my projects to git, and see how it works. 
thanks a lot.

Now this line I am putting is for readme-edits branch... I am learning Git now, I am late little bit,
but you know na, It's better late than never.

Hmm it seems I am getting git good.
But it's really a good way to code.
overall i feel like I will get it soon. 

yeah it's little bit tricky in the beginning.

but I master it in no time.
